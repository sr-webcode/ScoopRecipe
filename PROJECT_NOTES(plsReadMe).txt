 Hi!,

 This excericse was done using modern javascript, I did not use any framework of some sort.
 However, I did set up my own 'webpack.config' and installed some required dev dependencies to hasten up
 my development. 
 
   I was able to do the following things:

      -- accomplish goals dictated in the readme.file 
      -- was able to do bonus but only the recipes part
      -- used class base approach to building ui components and events
      -- used sass (scss notation) to create my own stylesheet 
      -- made it so the app is responsive on specific breakpoints
   
   The following has not been implemented yet:
       -- form validation on crud operation
   
      note: when searching for specific items or recipes that matches 2 or more uneven data, 
           you may see some odd space in the middle in between records, im using flexbox;
    
 I created a repo on my github profile so you can go ahead and clone it
