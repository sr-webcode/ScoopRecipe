 Hi!,

 This excericse was done using modern javascript, I did not use any framework of some sort.
 However, I set up my own webpack.config and installed some required dev dependencies to hasten up
 my development. I was able to do the following things:

    -- accomplish goals dictated in the readme.file 
    -- was able to do bonus but only on the recipes part
    -- used class base approach to building components and events
    -- used sass to create my own stylesheet specs
    -- made it so the app is responsive on specific breakpoints
 
 The following has not been implemented yet:
     -- form validation on crud operation
     -- lazy loading on images   
 
    
 I created a repo on my github profile so you can go ahead and clone it
