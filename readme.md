# Crescendo Collective - Frontend Skill Test

## Goals

For this javascript project we've provided a recipe API with two endpoints. With this API you'll need to complete the following objectives.


- _Bonus:_ Create a view to add and update recipes or specials. Image upload not required. Both endpoints support GET, POST and PATCH.

This project includes a API server (json-server) for you to use. To install and run, use the commands below:

- `npm i`
- `npm run start:api`

Once running, you can use the API endpoints listed in the following section from `http://localhost:3001`. More information about querying the server can be found on the [json-server github page](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
